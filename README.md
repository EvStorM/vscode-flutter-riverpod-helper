# Flutter Freezed Helpers VSCode Extension

This extension currently helps you to easily write `riverpod` annotated classes and allows you to run code generation for those classes. You can also watch the files so that code generation is faster.

## Setup your flutter project for code generation for JSONSerializable annotations

```ruby
dev_dependencies:
    // ...
    build_runner:
    freezed:
    riverpod_generator:
    json_serializable:

dependencies:
    // ...
    freezed_annotation:
    flutter_riverpod:
    json_annotation:
    riverpod_annotation:
    
```
